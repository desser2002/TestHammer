This is a Java 21 load testing library designed for efficient and flexible creation of load tests targeting HTTP and REST APIs. 
The primary goal is to provide users with a fast-to-deploy tool that also offers sufficient flexibility for advanced configuration.

* Lightweight design and minimal configuration complexity for quick startup.
* Flexible architecture that allows customizing load parameters as needed while maintaining ease of use.
* API request generation to facilitate efficient testing of web services.

This library aims to simplify and accelerate the process of load testing, enabling rapid deployment of realistic load scenarios that closely mimic real-world usage.
